Hello.

I don't really do code, but i sometimes upload simple schematics i make by hand, from something i own or a picture. 

I do this so i can try and preserve hardware and get used to KiCAD. I can't really say i'm a fan but it works.

I'm trying my best, but i am not very good at it, so if there's something wrong please tell me.
